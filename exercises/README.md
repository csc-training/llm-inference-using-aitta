# Jupyter notebook exercises


Basic knowledge of Python programming and Jupyter notebooks is required for the exercises.

Coding exercises are available through [CSC's Noppe service](https://noppe.2.rahtiapp.fi/welcome) for interactive web based applications ([CSC Docs](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/noppe/)). A dedicated workspace is set up for this course, allowing you to utilize an inference platform [Aitta](https://staging-aitta.2.rahtiapp.fi/) within a Jupyter notebook environment.  For more information on using Jupyter Notebooks, visit [Jupyter Documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/index.html). To access both the Noppe and Aitta webpages, you need a CSC account or Haka credits.

If you prefer to complete Jupyter notebook exercises in your own environment, ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher, along with the libraries listed in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file.
