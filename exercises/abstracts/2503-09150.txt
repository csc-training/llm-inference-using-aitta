Personalization is a critical yet often overlooked factor in boosting productivity and wellbeing in knowledge-intensive workplaces to better address individual preferences. Existing tools typically offer uniform guidance whether auto-generating email responses or prompting break reminders without accounting for individual behavioral patterns or stress triggers. We introduce AdaptAI, a multimodal AI solution combining egocentric vision and audio, heart and motion activities, and the agentic workflow of Large Language Models LLMs to deliver highly personalized productivity support and context-aware well-being interventions. AdaptAI not only automates peripheral tasks (e.g. drafting succinct document summaries, replying to emails etc.) but also continuously monitors the users unique physiological and situational indicators to dynamically tailor interventions such as micro-break suggestions or exercise prompts, at the exact point of need. In a preliminary study with 15 participants, AdaptAI demonstrated significant improvements in task throughput and user satisfaction by anticipating user stressors and streamlining daily workflows.
